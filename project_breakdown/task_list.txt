Things we know about the project:
* It will involve user interaction
* We're dealing with words as a thing that exists in our program
* We will have a timer that affects game state
* User actions will affect game state
* Persist data about win/loss count across page reloads

Game Interactions:
* When user presses a key, and correctly guesses a letter, we replace the blanks with that guessed letter.
* When user clicks the start button, the game starts. It is not started until this happens.
* The timer resets when the game starts
* When the game ends, the timer should stop, and a message should appear
* When the user correctly guesses the word, the game ends
* When the timer runs out, the game ends

TASKS:


As a user, I want to try and guess a word by filling in a number of blanks that match the number of letters in that word.

* We need to have a word
    * We need to define a variable that tracks the active word
        * Define a variable equal to a string
* We need to have some way of tracking the user's guesses
* We need a way to track the number of blanks, which should be equal to the word letter count
* We need a way to display the number of blanks
    * We need a container on the webpage that will hold the elements that represent the blank letters
    * We need a function that populates the above container based on the number of blanks
        * Define a function named generateBlanks
        * Fetch the container element from the DOM
            * Use document.getElementById to get a reference to the container
* We need a way to get keyboard input from the player
* When the user enters a key, we need to check it against the word and update the blanks
    * When the user enters a key, determine if its valid
    * Check if the key input exists in the word
    * If the key input does exist in the word, then update the blanks, replacing blanks with the appropriate letter at the appropriate place

As a user, I want the game to be timed.

* We need a variable that tracks seconds left in the game
* Every second the game is active, this variable decreases by 1
* This variable is displayed to the user

As a user, I want to win the game when I have guessed all the letters in the word.

* When the user has filled in all the blanks, the game should end
* We need to stop the timer
* We need to display a victory message

As a user, I want to lose the game when the timer runs out before I have guessed all the letters.

* When the timer runs out the game should end
* Instead of a victory message, display a defeat message

As a user, I want to see my total wins and losses on the screen.

* We need to define two variables, one to hold losses and one to hold wins
* When the game ends, we need to increment the wins variable in case of victory and the loss variable in case of defeat
* After incrementing, we need to persist these variables to localStorage
* When the page loads, we need to fetch these values from localStorage and put them into the win and loss variables
* When the game ends, show the wins and losses count in the final message

As a user, I want to start the game by clicking on a button.

* We need to create a button on the main page
* We need a variable to track if the game is started or not
* If the game is not started, the timer does not decrement
* If the game is not started, the user's keyboard input is ignored
* When the start game button is clicked, the game starts

Final Tasks (not handled elsewhere)

* Before the game starts, there is no chosen word
* We have a list of potential words defined in an array and assigned to a variable.
* When the game starts, we choose a word at random from the list and assign that as our chosen word
